# Lab 2 - Landing page

Create a web page for your/friends/relatives business (example: car-rent, cookies-shop, crypto-scam)

This project requires a live server to run - install Live server extension for vscode and open index.html

This is a technical requirement for separating the code into separate components and loading them dinamically




## Task:
### Customer requirements

- Some form of navigation to sections (links, buttons)
- Call to action
- At least 4 sections ([see examples](https://webflow.com/blog/high-converting-landing-page))
- Pleasant to the eyes

### Dev requirements

- Use vanilla CSS and HTML (no frameworks)
- Have a decent git history (no one commit)
- The page should be deployed on a free hosting service (example: GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify)
- Project repo should have a README with a short description of the landing page topic, screenshots, and a link to the live demo

### Other requirements:

- For potential maximal mark, a WIP version should be submitted during the class
- Use index.html, reset.css
